    "This notebook will introduce a key operational model&mdash;economic dispatch (ED)&mdash;which minimizes the short-run production costs of meeting electricity demand from a given set of generators subject to various technical constraints.\n",

    "We build up the model in several stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We begin with a single-time period and simple generator constraints just related to allowable output ranges. This allows us to compare the model with the intuition provided by the merit order supply curve (also known as the \"dispatch stack\").\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We then add multiple time periods by considering the economic dispatch over an entire day. Due to the simple generator constraints, this simple model does not introduce any coupling across time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. More realism is added by considering engineering constraints that introduce time coupling&mdash;namely, ramp rates, which are an important limitation of many generators.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We examine the famous \"duck curve\" by adding more solar onto the system and explore the role that ramp rates play in the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **NEW:** We extract **Locational Marginal Prices (LMPs)** from the demand constraint duals and compare with real CAISO market prices.\n",

    "6. **NEW:** We compare our model results with **actual CAISO generation and demand data** from 2023-2024.\n",

    "## Introduction to economic dispatch\n",
    "\n",
    "Every day, system operators need to decide how to meet demand from a large variety of generators with different costs and engineering requirements. Prior to large-scale computational capabilities, this was accomplished by \"priority lists\" or similar heuristics to determine the ordering of plants. However, with modern optimization algorithms, operators can find the global minimum of production costs&mdash;and even incorporate coupling of engineering processes across time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Economic dispatch** (ED) is the problem of minimizing short-run costs of production in order to meet a given demand, considering relevant engineering constraints of the generators. It *does not* fully capture the physics of electricity flows, which will further constrain the feasible space and which we will come back to in later notebooks on optimal power flow, nor does it account for decisions and constraints related to turning on or \"committing\" large thermal generators, which we'll discuss in our next notebook on unit commitment. Typically, *it does* incorporate some type of network representation, which we have ignored here by considering only a single bus. More on the networks in the notebook on optimal power flow."

    "The simplest response is that these costs have already been incurred and regardless of how much a generator produces, its fixed costs will not change. These costs are thus \"[sunk costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost)\" and are constant in the objective function. Our optimal decision variables would not change by adjusting this constant up or down. Therefore, we can safely ignore fixed costs for the purposes of finding optimal dispatch.

    "2. We assumed all generators have Pmin = 0, meaning they can smoothly reduce output to zero. Why is this unrealistic for a coal or nuclear plant? What kind of optimization problem do we need to handle the ON/OFF decision?\n",

    "4. Our model found two scenarios that were **infeasible**. In real power systems, infeasibility is not an option -- the lights must stay on. What \"safety valves\" do real system operators use? *(We will explore these in the UC and OPF seminars.)*\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this seminar, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Built an **economic dispatch model** from scratch using Pyomo and HiGHS\n",
    "- Progressed from single-period to multi-period models with increasing realism\n",
    "- Extracted **Locational Marginal Prices (LMPs)** from constraint duals\n",
    "- Explored the **duck curve** and its implications for system operations\n",
    "- Compared model results with **real CAISO data** from 2023-2024\n",
    "- Identified **model limitations** by deliberately breaking it\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's next?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unit Commitment**: Adding binary ON/OFF decisions for generators, startup costs, minimum up/down times, and proper Pmin handling\n",
    "- **Optimal Power Flow**: Adding network topology, transmission constraints, and spatially varying LMPs"
