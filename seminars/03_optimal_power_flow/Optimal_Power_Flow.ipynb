    "This notebook provides an introduction to the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem in electric power systems&mdash;which minimizes the short-run production costs of meeting electricity demand at a number of connected locations from a given set of generators subject to various technical and transmission network flow limit constraints. This will be our first treatment of a *network*, which is critical to all power systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will introduce a linear approximation to the AC optimal power flow problem known as \"**DC-OPF**\", where we begin to incorporate some of the physics involved in how electricity flows along transmission lines. With this formulation, we recognize that given \"injections\" (i.e., generation) and \"withdrawals\" (i.e., demand) of power at each node in the network, flows along lines are not independently controllable. Instead, electrical power flows across transmission lines in relation to their physical properties, namely power flows across parallel circuits or paths in inverse proportion to the [electrical impedance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance) of the lines. This can (very frequently) result in hitting flow constraints before we would if could control power flows across all lines as in the transport problem."

    "## Introduction to OPF\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem is a power system optimal scheduling problem which captures the physics of electricity flows across electricity networks, adding a layer of complexity and more realism to the Economic Dispatch (ED) problem. OPF usually attempts to capture the entire network topology by representing the transmission line interconnections between different nodes (also known as buses, or locations where generators or demand inject or withdraw power into/from the network) including various electrical parameters, such as resistance, series reactance, shunt admittance, etc. The full alternating current or \"AC\" OPF is a non-convex problem and turns out to be an extremely hard problem to solve (usually NP-hard). Hence, system operators and power marketers usually go about solving a linearized version of it, called the \"DC-OPF.\" The DC-OPF approximation works satisfactorily for bulk power transmission networks as long as such networks are not operated at the brink of instability or under heavily loaded conditions."

An AC current flowing across a conductor encountering either [inductive reactance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance#Inductive_reactance) (which relates to the magnetizing current, or the energy required to continually induce or establish magnetic fields around a conductor as AC current polarity flips each cycle) or [capacitive reactance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance#Capacitive_reactance) (which relates to the charging current, or the energy required to sustain capacitive charges between two conductors separated by an insulator) will experience a shift in the voltage waveform, relative to the current wave form. Inductive reactance causes the voltage waveform to shift forward relative to the current, while capacitive reactive cases the voltage to shift backwards relative to the current. In overhead transmission lines, the primary source of voltage phase angle shifts is the inductance of the transmission lines themselves (although capacitance is relevant for underground lines).\n",
