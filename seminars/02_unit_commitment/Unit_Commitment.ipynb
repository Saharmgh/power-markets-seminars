    "This notebook will build on the economic dispatch (ED) model by introducing binary startup (called \"commitment\") decisions, constraints, and costs of thermal generators. Similar to ED, it minimizes the short-run production costs of meeting electricity demand, but these additions are necessary for operating systems with large amounts of (inflexible) thermal generation. They also entail significant computational trade-offs.\n",

    "We build up the model in several stages. We first start with the simplest model that incorporates unit commitment decisions in order to understand the logic of three-variable commitment formulations.\n",

    "## Introduction to unit commitment\n",
    "\n",
    "Engineering considerations severely limit the possible output ranges of power plants. System operators need to be aware of these limitations when scheduling generation to meet demand. Thermal power plants, in particular, due to their complex designs, thermodynamic cycles, and material properties, can be particularly challenging. In practice, due to the times involved in bringing these power plants online, much of this scheduling is done day-ahead, which gives rise to the need for a day-ahead market.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unit commitment** (UC) is the problem of minimizing short-run costs of production inclusive of production and startup costs, in order to meet a given demand and considering relevant engineering constraints of the generators. It is built on the ED model in that it typically considers all of the same variables in addition to the new startup-related variables and constraints&mdash;hence, it is also sometimes called unit commitment and economic dispatch (UCED). This notebook, for simplicity, only considers a single-bus case, while typical formulations usually include a simplified network representation."

Spinning reserves refer to generation capacity that is online and able to generate (e.g., within 10-30 minutes) if needed by the system operator. (Note: in Europe, these are referred to as 'replacement reserves' or formerly 'tertiary reserves.') The SO will establish reserve requirements to maintain sufficient capacity to respond to demand or supply forecast errors or in case of \"contingencies,\" such as the unplanned and sudden loss of a generating station or a transmission line. The SO then typically operates a reserve market to competitively procure this available capacity. Most SO's actually define several classes of reserve products defined by their response time and period over which they may be activated.\n",
